// Code Units Vs. UTF-16
/*
* JavaScript strings are encoded as a sequence of 16-bit numbers, these are called CODE UNITS.
* A Unicode character code was initially supposed to fit within suhc a unit (over 65000), not enough 
* So there was a need to use more momory per character ---> UTF-16 was invented 
* UTF-16 describes most common characters using a single 16-bit code unit 
* , but uses a pair of two such units for others (less common characters).
* Now we have charcters with one unit and others with two units (a problem)
* but, with the advent of emoji, everybody has started using two-unit characters.
* 
* ** String operations and length property: 
* Operations of javaScript strings, such as getting their length through the length property 
* and accessing their content usin square brackets, deal only with code units
